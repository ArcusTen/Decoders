# Hex to ASCII Converter

This Python script provides a simple tool for converting hexadecimal data into its corresponding ASCII representation. It's particularly useful when dealing with hex-encoded content, such as binary data or hexadecimal strings. The script takes a hex input file, processes its content, and outputs the corresponding ASCII text.

## Features

- **Hex to ASCII Conversion:** Converts hexadecimal data to ASCII text.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface for quick conversions.
- **Error Handling:** Provides error handling for invalid hex values during conversion.
- **File I/O:** Reads input from a hex file and writes the ASCII output to a specified file.

## Usage

To use the script, run it from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
python script.py input_file output_file

## Requirements

Python 3.x

## Example

Replace input_file with the path to your hex-encoded file and output_file with the desired path for the resulting ASCII text.

```bash
python script.py input.hex output.txt
